# Retrospectives & Decisions

## 20250220

### Went well

- Having the repo set up in advance
- Using the code space was faster than sharing from a local machine.
- Using a familiar mob timer
- Useful topic. Everyone can benefit from a project page.

### Do differently:

- Help Prepare the description of the milestones and activities.
- Announce early (more than 72 hours)
- Include the resources and docs for the session
- Include client lives share Troubleshooting tips (connection error)
- Create Github Issues/Discussions for the next session.

## Decisions

- Decide how to intro latecomers
- Longer rotations (5 mins now)?
- Why Static pages: 
Static websites are safer, use fewer resources, and avoid vendor and platform lock-in. You can host a Nikola website on any web server, big or small.
